# AstroNews
This repository contains a personal development project that was undertaken to enhance familiarity with the Symfony framework before starting work on the Tipee tool during my first job. The purpose of this project is to create a blog centered around one of my passions: astronomy. Please note that this project is not intended for deployment or personnal usage and has been discontinued. It is made visible on GitHub solely for portfolio purposes and to showcase my skills and capabilities as a developer.

## Features

Admin & User Accounts: The system supports both admin and user accounts, each having different rights and privileges. Administrators have the ability to manage blog content and user accounts, while regular users can interact with the blog, subscribe to categories, and receive interactive notifications.

Categories: Articles are organized into categories, making it easier for users to find content related to their interests within the field of astronomy.

List of Articles & Categories: The blog provides a user-friendly interface to view a list of articles and categories, allowing users to browse through the content seamlessly.

Subscriptions & Notifications: Users have the option to subscribe to specific categories, enabling them to receive interactive notifications whenever new articles are published within their subscribed categories.

## Technology Used
The project is built using the following technologies:

PHP: The server-side programming language used for developing the blog's backend functionalities.

Symfony 5: A robust and popular PHP web application framework, which forms the backbone of the Astronomy Blog project. It provides a foundation for creating scalable and maintainable web applications.

Bootstrap: A responsive front-end framework that ensures the blog's design is visually appealing and compatible with various devices and screen sizes.

Twig: The templating engine used with Symfony to create dynamic and reusable HTML templates for the blog's frontend.

REST API: The project might include a RESTful API to facilitate data exchange between the frontend and backend, enabling smooth and efficient communication.

## Repository Purpose
This GitHub repository serves as a showcase of my web development skills and my proficiency in using Symfony to build web applications. It was created as part of a team integration project during my initial job, with the primary aim of getting acquainted with Symfony before starting work on the Tipee tool. As the project is no longer actively maintained, it remains here purely for demonstrative purposes, allowing potential employers and collaborators to assess my coding style and problem-solving capabilities.

## Disclaimer
As this is a discontinued personal project created for educational and portfolio purposes, please refrain from using it. While efforts have been made to ensure the code was functional and secure back in start of 2020, it may not be working nowadays, and no further updates or fixes will be provided (excepts some changes I can make to improve my skills).
